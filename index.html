          <p>Second Chance Chi is a collaborative effort created by animal lovers who recognize
           that the highest percentage of dogs killed in shelters are chihuahuas and chihuahua
            mixes. With love and hope for a change , we join together to save lives, one life
             at a time. Our goal is to redesign the current site to reinstate the companies
              digital footprint. By doing so, Second Chance Chi can be brought up to par with
               shelter competitors, boosting adoptions, and throttling community outreach, 
               allowing for increased funding and website traffic.

        <p class="text">Second Chance Chi is a Shelter in Utah that has lost its digital touch.
         Myself and a team of three other UX/UI designers chose to tackle this problem for the 
         nonprofit organization by conducting a 3 week project to redesign the website in its 
         entirety. Over the time we broke the project into four phases: Research, Information 
         Architecture, Design, and Prototyping.
         <br>
         <p class="text">
          During the first three days of the project we overhauled data through series of user
           interviews and original website testing. We chose users whom had direct experience 
           with shelters in all aspects pertaining to adoption, fostering, and volunteering with
            a direct focus on adoption. We tailored our testing and interview plan specifically
             to those whom have used a shelter before so we could better understand what a normal
              adoption process goes like. By doing so, we were able to identify pain points and 
              success areas based on user experiences that we could avoid and incorporate into our
               redesign.

      <div class="col col2">
        <p class="text">
          Over the course of 5 initial test and 5 interviews we are able to determine that 
          the current site was unusable and overall useless and that it was lacking many as
          pects that users desired. Our participants desired informative pages, simplicity, 
          straightforward design, and a trustworthy feel.
          Upon completing our initial rounds of interviews and test we were able to create 
          an affinity diagram highlighting key areas in our findings. Some highlights from 
          our findings are that participants found many shelters lack viable information on 
          the animals and that they desired a trustworthy design that made sense. The current
           site Second Chance Chi is hosting is plagued by those exact issues. The data gath
           ered at this point allowed us to create a persona of our ideal user of the site 
           whom looks like a driven dog lover whom has a passion for adopting dogs in hopes o
           f establishing a forever home for them. This persona additionally is dedicated to t
           he cause, and advocates for the reason behind rescues devoting time as a foster pa
           rent and volunteer, supporting the rescue by all means.

        <p class="text">
          What is the problem?
        <br>
          Second Chance Chi is plagued by outdated design elements, limited functionality, and
           a lack of user engagement, rendering it ineffective in the highly competitive dog rescue
            and adoptions industry. In order to establish a strong presence and remain competitive,
             the website requires a comprehensive redesign to address the critical shortcomings it
              has acquired.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="text">       
          How can it be solved?
        <br>
          This issue could be solved by creating a simplistic and personable website which will result
           in a better user experience. This new website will increase the amount of donations received
            directly supporting the care of animals and resulting in an increased amount of dogs being saved.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="text">
          By identifying the problem and the hypothesis we now have a streamlined path to a solution for
           the organization. We felt the need here to conduct competitor analysis on four similar 
           organizations to gauge the competition and to analyze what the Second Chance Chi was missing
            that we could incorporate. Some key findings that other organizations had our target didnâ€™t
             were community stories, thorough pet information, quality designs, and easy navigation. We 
             found that our website needed to incorporate these to be a running competitor in this race.

          At this point in the research we felt that we had gathered enough valuable data for the website to
           begin prioritizing features to incorporate in our redesign. We identified 12 features and applied
            them across a prioritization chart and began acting on the perfect blend of features that would 
            be most impactful with mid complexity. Prime features to incorporate are the volunteer ops, 
            adoption stories, and design modernization. Lastly we completed our heuristic evaluation to 
            provide a final overarching summary of the current design to establish a rounded perspective of
             the current design. Insights from that evaluation revealed the appearance was outdated and 
             unfriendly, the content was redundant, the navigation was unclear, and lastly the site was plagued
              by latency and form issues.

  At this time our team had hashed out what needed to be included into the redesigned site, but we had to decipher
   what was necessary based on what was already there. We began card sorting the website laying out the linkage 
   and hierarchy to grasp a visual interpretation of the site contents. Upon tabbing the site we were able to redact
    40% of the current linkage by getting rid of faulty content and redundant linkage. Doing so also allowed us 
    to group many elements by similarity resulting in a better flow of site content.

</div>
<div class="aText">
  <p class="aText">
    After card sorting we created a sitemap to layout the structure of the website that we would base our design on. 
    The sitemap helped us to set up a home page navigation that allows users to easily access all of the pages for this
     site. It also will help the users to clearly understand all the services offered with this organization streamlining
      simplicity that the original site lacked. The next focus of the site was to establish a streamlined user flow. 
      Our aim for the flow of the site was to be direct and to be able to complete task in a minimal amount of clicks.
       Our flow creation did just that and made for a seamless task completion. Last but not least we did another 
       overall analysis of the site content and deemed that all elements should be grouped together and categorized 
       based on similarity. The original site had three site menus with cluttered and redundant means of navigation. 
       Often our users were getting lost when trying to complete the usability task on the original website therefore 
       we wanted to avoid the confusion by grouping by likeness.

          The first step of the design phase for the redesign was to establish a new color palette. Throughout initial
           testing our users noted that the original sites palette was unfriendly, harsh, and detracted from the website.
            Over our competitor analysis we saw how dark and sad Second Chance Chi was and how the competition was bright
             and happy. Our test revealed that users desired that aspect of happiness so we created four mood boards among
              ourselves and then chose to adopt a sky blue, tan, and sand yellow palette based on the groups combination 
              of colors. Testing proved this color choice was right as users claimed it fixed the issue the site had before.

        <p class="text">
          The next goal in the design was creating usability. Before, users struggled to complete task therefore by 
          incorporating our user flow and site map ideas we were able to alleviate test failure. We chose to utilize large 
          buttons with fair spacing to disrupt the feel of clutter on the redesign.
          <br>
          <br>
          Our final objective to seal the design of the site was to make it sleek and modernized. The current site seemed to
           be inspired by an outdated design template featuring small text, boxy fields, and no rounding or color depth. We
            strayed away from that design entirely by incorporating contrasting fields and some miniscule shadowing to give
             off a modernized feel that users would love. Additionally we included smooth micro interactions on the website
              to give a small sense of satisfaction to every slick and hover on the site.

<div class="aText">
  <p class="aText">
    In prototyping we initially took our design ideas and applied them over sketches that each team member submitted for
     suggestion. The initial sketches from the team revealed that there was a clear goal and expectation for the websites
      redesign as the sketches each had similarities. The sketches included a sleek navigation bar, hero images, as well 
      as focus on the CTAâ€™s.

    Now that it was established it was time to begin testing. Upon completing five user test on the prototype, users deemed the site much better
     than the original. The suggestions users had that we implemented were moving the community stories and adoptable dogs to stack instead of being
      side by side to show more image. By doing so users found this to be easier on the eyes and a smoother experience which we desired. With 
      satisfied users and a solid design, we decided to start implementing a high fidelity design to begin testing.

          The high fidelity design featured large high quality photos as well as redesigned and modernized form fields. Once the design was completed
           we began to complete more testing where we took our original usability test and put them into trial once again. Usability testing on the 
           redesign site turned to have a 100% success rate. On this first iteration some gathered insights to fix were prototyping errors, updating 
           the donation page to be modern and trustworthy, and to condense long hero text to avoid overwhelming users.

    More test revealed some more issues with the site and those were that the Q&A text on the sites were excessive therefore, we created an 
    accordion component to hold the Q&A info which users preferred. Our last focus was that users had issues with the adoption and foster page. 
    The users observed that there were not enough animals visible on the page and that it was consumed by the adoption form. Our final iteration 
    implemented a renewed pagination page which would host more than three animals like before. The page would feature a pagination structure to 
    show customers where they were on the page and to give more thorough info on the pets at first glance. The adoption form was also removed from
     the site overlay and was replaced with a link on the selected animal.

    At last, our design was complete and was fully adopted based on user research and testing. The Web redesign that we created for Second Chance Chi
     is more modern, user friendly, and creates an environment where dog lovers could participate in a simpler adoption process, as well as fostering 
     and observing the use of the donations that are made. This new design will keep users coming back again and again to participate in helping advocate
      for these dogs in need. It will also help bring more donations to the page and allow users to see current stories of dogs that have been saved.
