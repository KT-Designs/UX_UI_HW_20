          <p>Second Chance Chi is a collaborative effort created by animal lovers who recognize
           that the highest percentage of dogs killed in shelters are chihuahuas and chihuahua
            mixes. With love and hope for a change , we join together to save lives, one life
             at a time. Our goal is to redesign the current site to reinstate the companies
              digital footprint. By doing so, Second Chance Chi can be brought up to par with
               shelter competitors, boosting adoptions, and throttling community outreach, 
               allowing for increased funding and website traffic.

        <p class="text">Second Chance Chi is a Shelter in Utah that has lost its digital touch.
         Myself and a team of three other UX/UI designers chose to tackle this problem for the 
         nonprofit organization by conducting a 3 week project to redesign the website in its 
         entirety. Over the time we broke the project into four phases: Research, Information 
         Architecture, Design, and Prototyping.
         <br>
         <p class="text">
          During the first three days of the project we overhauled data through series of user
           interviews and original website testing. We chose users whom had direct experience 
           with shelters in all aspects pertaining to adoption, fostering, and volunteering with
            a direct focus on adoption. We tailored our testing and interview plan specifically
             to those whom have used a shelter before so we could better understand what a normal
              adoption process goes like. By doing so, we were able to identify pain points and 
              success areas based on user experiences that we could avoid and incorporate into our
               redesign.

      <div class="col col2">
        <p class="text">
          Over the course of 5 initial test and 5 interviews we are able to determine that 
          the current site was unusable and overall useless and that it was lacking many as
          pects that users desired. Our participants desired informative pages, simplicity, 
          straightforward design, and a trustworthy feel.
          Upon completing our initial rounds of interviews and test we were able to create 
          an affinity diagram highlighting key areas in our findings. Some highlights from 
          our findings are that participants found many shelters lack viable information on 
          the animals and that they desired a trustworthy design that made sense. The current
           site Second Chance Chi is hosting is plagued by those exact issues. The data gath
           ered at this point allowed us to create a persona of our ideal user of the site 
           whom looks like a driven dog lover whom has a passion for adopting dogs in hopes o
           f establishing a forever home for them. This persona additionally is dedicated to t
           he cause, and advocates for the reason behind rescues devoting time as a foster pa
           rent and volunteer, supporting the rescue by all means.

          What is the problem?
        <br>
          Second Chance Chi is plagued by outdated design elements, limited functionality, and
           a lack of user engagement, rendering it ineffective in the highly competitive dog rescue
            and adoptions industry. In order to establish a strong presence and remain competitive,
             the website requires a comprehensive redesign to address the critical shortcomings it
              has acquired.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="text">       
          How can it be solved?
        <br>
          This issue could be solved by creating a simplistic and personable website which will result
           in a better user experience. This new website will increase the amount of donations received
            directly supporting the care of animals and resulting in an increased amount of dogs being saved.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="text">
          By identifying the problem and the hypothesis we now have a streamlined path to a solution for
           the organization. We felt the need here to conduct competitor analysis on four similar 
           organizations to gauge the competition and to analyze what the Second Chance Chi was missing
            that we could incorporate. Some key findings that other organizations had our target didnâ€™t
             were community stories, thorough pet information, quality designs, and easy navigation. We 
             found that our website needed to incorporate these to be a running competitor in this race.
